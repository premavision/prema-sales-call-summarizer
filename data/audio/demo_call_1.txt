Hi, this is Den from Prema Vision. Thanks for taking the time today. Before we dive in, I’d love to get a quick overview of what you’re currently using for workflow automation and where the main bottlenecks are.

From what you mentioned earlier, it sounds like your team spends a lot of time manually summarizing customer calls, updating your CRM, and sharing tasks internally. Usually, when I hear that, it means two things: first, the process slows down follow-ups, and second, important details sometimes slip through the cracks. Let me know if that resonates.

In terms of what you’re looking for, I heard three priorities: improving response time, reducing manual data entry, and having more consistent notes for your sales team. Did I miss anything?

Now, regarding pricing — we typically offer a flexible tier depending on volume. For smaller teams, the starter plan is usually enough, but for companies that have more than a hundred calls per month, the pro plan tends to be a better fit because it includes automated CRM syncing and priority support. I can walk you through that after the call.

A quick concern I want to address: the integration process is pretty lightweight. You won’t need engineering resources on your side. Most clients fully onboard within a day. The only limitation to be aware of is that certain CRM fields might need initial mapping, but we guide you through that.

Before we wrap up, here are the next steps that I’d suggest: I’ll send you a detailed pricing comparison with a recommendation based on your volume, I’ll share our onboarding playbook, and we can schedule a technical validation call with your operations team. Does that work for you?

Great — thanks again for your time. I'll follow up with the summary and next steps right after this call.
